# Synthesis-Rebeca
We use a program synthesizer tool (Rosette) to generate specific programs in a domain-specific language (DSL). 
We consider Rebeca reactive language as a DSL and get an assertion in order to automatically synthesis Rebeca codes. 
The specification is a syntax file of the Rebeca language.
